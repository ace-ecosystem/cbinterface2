# cbinterface

`cbinterface` is a command line tool and library for interfacing with one or more Carbon Black environments. 

As of now, `cbinterface` primarily supports Carbon Black PSC EDR (Threathunter) and Carbon Black Response. However, a lot of functionality should also work with other CBC products, like Enterprise Standard. If you're using Enterprise Standard and something doesn't work, open an issue and I can likely swap out an underlying object and have it working quickly.
